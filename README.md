# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis 🛒

A complete end-to-end data analytics project exploring shopping behavior using SQL, Python, Excel and Power BI.  

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This project analyses a retail-shopping dataset to uncover insights into customer behavior, purchase patterns, and business metrics. It walks through the full data pipeline — from data cleaning, processing and querying to visualization and dashboard creation — to demonstrate how raw data can be transformed into actionable business intelligence.

## 🔍 Data & Tools Used

- **Dataset**: `customer_shopping_behavior.csv` (customer transactions, purchase details, demographics, etc.)  
- **Data cleaning & EDA**: Python (Pandas), Jupyter Notebook  
- **Data querying & analysis**: SQL (MySQL / any preferred SQL engine)  
- **Visualization & Dashboard**: Power BI

## 🚀 Workflow / What I Did

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Loaded raw data, handled missing values, fixed inconsistencies, standardized column names.  
   - Performed basic cleaning and transformations so data is ready for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Explored customer demographics, purchase frequencies, product categories, seasonal trends, etc.  
   - Used Python for aggregation, summarization, and initial insights.

3. **Database Load & SQL Analysis**  
   - Loaded cleaned data into a SQL database.  
   - Created and ran SQL queries to answer real-world business questions: e.g. top categories, revenue by customer segment, purchase trends over time.

4. **Visualization & Dashboard Creation**  
   - Built a dashboard using Power BI (or Excel) to summarize key metrics: sales distribution, customer segmentation, insights into shopping behavior.  
   - The dashboard helps stakeholders quickly grasp important findings.

## 🎯 Key Insights (Sample / Hypothetical — update based on your results)

- Which product categories generate the most revenue  
- Customer segments by age/gender/location and their spending habits  
- Seasonal or monthly purchase trends  
- Popular items, average basket size, repeat-purchase analysis  

*(Replace above bullets with actual insights from your project)*

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use / Run This Project

1. Download or clone the repository  
2. Inspect the raw data and notebook for cleaning & EDA  
3. Load cleaned data into your SQL database (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL)  
4. Run SQL queries from `customer_shopping_behavior.sql.sql`  
5. If you have Power BI Desktop — open `customer_behavior.pbix` to view dashboards  
6. Explore data, modify or add new queries/visualizations as needed
